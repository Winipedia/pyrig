# protect-repo

Configures repository protection settings and branch protection rulesets on
GitHub.

## Usage

```bash
uv run pyrig protect-repo

# With verbose output to see API requests and responses
uv run pyrig -v protect-repo

# With detailed debug logging
uv run pyrig -vv protect-repo
```

## What It Does

The `protect-repo` command applies pyrig's opinionated security defaults to your
GitHub repository in two steps:

### 1. Repository Settings

Configures repository-level settings:

- **Description**: Sets from `pyproject.toml` project description
- **Default Branch**: Sets to `main`
- **Delete Branch on Merge**: Enabled (keeps repository clean)
- **Allow Update Branch**: Enabled (allows updating PR branches)
- **Merge Commits**: Disabled (enforces squash or rebase for linear history)
- **Rebase Merge**: Enabled
- **Squash Merge**: Enabled

### 2. Branch Protection Ruleset

Creates or updates a ruleset named `main-protection` with comprehensive
protection rules loaded from `branch-protection.json`:

#### Deletion Protection

Prevents deletion of the main branch.

#### Non-Fast-Forward Protection

Prevents force pushes that rewrite history.

#### Creation Protection

Controls branch creation patterns.

#### Update Protection

Requires pull requests for updates.

#### Pull Request Requirements

- **Required Approving Reviews**: 1 approval required
- **Dismiss Stale Reviews**: Reviews dismissed when new commits pushed
- **Code Owner Review**: Requires approval from code owners
- **Last Push Approval**: Requires approval after the last push
- **Review Thread Resolution**: All review threads must be resolved
- **Allowed Merge Methods**: Squash and rebase only

#### Linear History Requirement

Enforces linear commit history (no merge commits).

#### Signature Requirement

Requires signed commits for security.

#### Status Check Requirements

- **Strict Policy**: Branch must be up to date before merging
- **Do Not Enforce on Create**: Enabled (allows initial branch creation)
- **Required Checks**: `health_check` job must pass

Note: The other workflows are not triggered by a passing health check here
because it is not running on main when doing a Pull Request.

#### Bypass Actors

Repository admins can bypass all rules (actor_id: 5, actor_type: RepositoryRole,
bypass_mode: always).

## Configuration File

The branch protection rules are defined in `branch-protection.json`, which is
automatically generated by pyrig when you run:

```bash
uv run pyrig mkroot
```

The `BranchProtectionConfigFile` class (in
`pyrig.dev.configs.branch_protection`) programmatically generates this
configuration file. The `protect-repo` command loads this file and applies it to
GitHub via the API.

This approach provides:

- **Version control**: Protection rules are tracked in git
- **Transparency**: Rules are visible in a standard JSON format
- **Portability**: File can be manually uploaded to GitHub if needed
- **Customization**: Subclass `BranchProtectionConfigFile` to modify rules

See [branch-protection.json documentation](../../configs/branch_protection.md)
for details on the configuration structure and customization.

## Environment Variables

Requires `REPO_TOKEN` environment variable with GitHub personal access token.

### Required Token Permissions

The token must have these permissions:

- `administration: read, write`

Not required by protect-repo but required for other pyrig commands:

- `contents: read, write`
- `pages: read, write`

## When to Use

You should not have to use it as it runs as part of the health check workflow.

But in case you want to run it manually you can use `protect-repo` when:

- Setting up a new repository
- Updating protection rules after changes
- Ensuring repository follows security best practices

## Autouse Fixture

This command **runs automatically** in the Health Check workflow during CI/CD.
See [Health Check Workflow](../../configs/workflows/health_check.md) for
details.

The command is called in the "Protect Repository" step to ensure protection
rules are always up to date.
